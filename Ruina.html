    <h3>MIDWAY upon the journey of our life
        I found myself within a forest dark,
        For the straightforward pathway had been lost.
        <br>
        Ah me! how hard a thing it is to say
        What was this forest savage, rough, and stern,
        Which in the very thought renews the fear.
        <br>
        So bitter is it, death is little more;
        But of the good to treat, which there I found,
        Speak will I of the other things I saw there.
        <br>
        I cannot well repeat how there I entered,
        So full was I of slumber at the moment
        In which I had abandoned the true way.
        <br>
        But after I had reached a mountain’s foot,
        At that point where the valley terminated,
        Which had with consternation pierced my heart,
        <br>
        Upward I looked, and I beheld its shoulders
        Vested already with that planet’s rays
        Which leadeth others right by every road.
        <br>
        Then was the fear a little quieted
        That in my heart’s lake had endured throughout
        The night, which I had passed so piteously
        <br>
        And even as he, who, with distressful breath,
        Forth issued from the sea upon the shore,
        Turns to the water perilous and gazes;
        <br>
        So did my soul, that still was fleeing onward,
        Turn itself back to re-behold the pass
        Which never yet a living person left.
        <br>
        After my weary body I had rested,
        The way resumed I on the desert slope,
        So that the firm foot ever was the lower.
        <br>
        And lo! almost where the ascent began,
        A panther light and swift exceedingly,
        Which with a spotted skin was covered o’er!
        <br>
        And never moved she from before my face,
        Nay, rather did impede so much my way,
        That many times I to return had turned.
        <br>
        The time was the beginning of the morning,
        And up the sun was mounting with those stars
        That with him were, what time the Love Divine
        <br>
        At first in motion set those beauteous things;
        So were to me occasion of good hope,
        The variegaled skin of that wild beast,
        <br>
        The hour of time, and the delicious season;
        But not so much, that did not give me fear
        A lion’s aspect which appeared to me.
        <br>
        He seemed as if against me he were coming
        With head uplifted, and with ravenous hunger,
        So that it seemed the air was afraid of him;
        <br>
        And a she-wolf, that with all hungerings
        Seemed to be laden in her meagreness,
        And many folk has caused to live forlorn!
        <br>
        She brought upon me so much heaviness,
        With the affright that from her aspect came,
        That I the hope relinquished of the height.
        <br>
        And as he is who willingly acquires
        And the time comes that causes him to lose,
        Who weeps in all his thoughts and is despondent,
        <br>
        E’en such made me that beast withouten peace,
        Which, coming on against me by degrees
        Thrust me back thither where the sun is silent
        <br>
        While I was rushing downward to the lowland,
        Before mine eyes did one present himself,
        Who seemed from long-continued silence hoarse.
        <br>
        When I beheld him in the desert vast,
        “Have pity on me,” unto him I cried,
        “Whiche’er thou art, or shade or real man!”
        <br>
        He answered me: “Not man; man once I was,
        And both my parents were of Lombardy,
        And Mantuans by country both of them.
        <br>
        Sub Julio was I born, though it was late,
        And lived at Rome under the good Augustus,
        During the time of false and Iying gods.
        <br>
        A poet was I, and I sang that just
        Son of Anchises, who came forth from Troy,
        After that Ilion the superb was burned
        <br>
        But thou, why goest thou back to such annoyance?
        Why climb’st thou not the Mount Delectable
        Which is the source and cause of every joy?”
        <br>
        “Now, art thou that Virgilius and that fountain
        Which spreads abroad so wide a river of speech?
        I made response to him with bashful forehead.
        <br>
        “O, of the other poets honour and light,
        Avail me the long study and great love
        That have impelled me to explore thy volume!
        <br>
        Thou art my master, and my author thou,
        Thou art alone the one from whom I took
        The beautiful style that has done honour to me.
        <br>
        Behold the beast, for which I have turned back;
        Do thou protect me from her, famous Sage,
        For she doth make my veins and pulses tremble.’
        <br>
        “Thee it behoves to take another road,”
        Responded he, when he beheld me weeping,
        “If from this savage place thou wouldst escape;
        <br>
        Because this beast, at which thou criest out,
        Suffers not any one to pass her way,
        But so doth harass him, that she destroys him;
        <br>
        And has a nature so malign and ruthless,
        That never doth she glut her greedy will,
        And after food is hungrier than before.
        <br>
        Many the animals with whom she weds,
        And more they shall be still, until the Greyhound
        Comes, who shall make her perish in her pain.
        <br>
        He shall not feed on either earth or pelf,
        But upon wisdom, and on love and virtue;
        ‘Twixt Feltro and Feltro shall his nation be;
        <br>
        Of that low Italy shall he be the saviour,
        On whose account the maid Camilla died,
        Euryalus, Turnus, Nisus, of their wounds;
        <br>
        Through every city shall he hunt her down,
        Until he shall have driven her back to Hell,
        There from whence envy first did let her loose.
        <br>
        Therefore I think and judge it for thy best
        Thou follow me, and I will be thy guide,
        And lead thee hence through the eternal place,
        <br>
        Where thou shalt hear the desperate lamentations,
        Shalt see the ancient spirits disconsolate,
        Who cry out each one for the second death;
        <br>
        And thou shalt see those who contented are
        Within the fire, because they hope to come,
        Whene’er it may be, to the blessed people;
        <br>
        To whom, then, if thou wishest to ascend,
        A soul shall be for that than I more worthy;
        With her at my departure I will leave thee;
        <br>
        Because that Emperor, who reigns above,
        In that I was rebellious to his law,
        Wills that through me none come into his city.
        <br>
        Governs evervwhere and there he reigns:
        There is his city and his lofty throne;
        O happy he whom thereto he elects!”
        <br>
        And I to him: ” Poet, I thee entreat,
        By that same God whom thou didst never know,
        So that I may escape this woe and worse,
        <br>
        Thou wouldst conduct me there where thou hast said,
        That I may see the portal of Saint Peter,
        And those thou makest so disconsolable.”
        <br>
        Then he moved on, and I behind him followed.</h3>
